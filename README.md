# hangman game

Group: Weronika Bałd, Karolina Pawłowska

This project is a web-based Hangman game where players guess letters to form a word. The game features a simple user interface with a "fruits" theme. Players can input their name, and the game tracks their wins and losses. The game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
1. User can input their name, which is reflected on the screen.
2. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of fruits.
3. User guesses letters; correct guesses reveal the letter in the word and chosen letters disappearing.
4. Incorrect guesses result in a hangman image progressing through stages and chosen letters disappearing.
5. Tracks and displays the player's win/loss record.
6. User can reroll the fruit name.

3. Click on the letters to make a guess.
4. Try to guess the word before the hangman image is fully displayed.
